## Introduction
This project explores innovative ways to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday coding practices, focusing on debugging and automation. By leveraging ChatGPT, developers can enhance their problem-solving skills and increase productivity in software development.

## Objectives
- Improve debugging efficiency using AI-assisted techniques
- Automate repetitive coding tasks to increase productivity
- Enhance code quality through AI-driven insights

## Features
- AI-assisted debugging across multiple programming languages
- Automated generation of boilerplate code
- AI-powered documentation creation
- Basic unit test generation

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies (list them here)
3. Set up your API key for ChatGPT access

## Usage

### Debugging with ChatGPT
1. Copy problematic code into ChatGPT
2. Describe the error or unexpected behavior
3. Request analysis and correction suggestions

### Automating Tasks
1. Use ChatGPT to generate boilerplate code
2. Create documentation automatically
3. Generate basic unit tests for your functions

## Best Practices
- Always verify ChatGPT's suggestions before implementation
- Use ChatGPT as an assistance tool, not a replacement for your skills
- Practice regularly to improve your prompts and get better results
